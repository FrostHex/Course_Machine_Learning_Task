# The Mini Project of Machine Learning
A mini-project which predicting whether a narrated story is true or not.

The datasets of 100 wav audio files can be load in this page: \
https://github.com/CBU5201Datasets/Deception

A CSV file recording the *Language* attribute and *Story Type* of each audio file can be downloaded from: \
https://github.com/CBU5201Datasets/Deception/blob/main/CBU0521DD_stories_attributes.csv

In this repository the audio files need to be loaded into `./Datasets/CBU0521DD_stories/`, and the csv files need to be loaded into `./Datasets/`

The method of Logistic Regression and K-Means are implemented, and the average accuracy of 1000 experiments is `51.46%`.
